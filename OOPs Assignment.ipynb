    "Answer:-\n",
    "  Encapsulation is one of the four principles used in Object Oriented Paradigm. It is used to bind and hide data to the class. Data hiding is also referred as Scoping and the accessibility of a method or a field of a class can be changed by the developer. The implementation of scoping is different for different programming language. For example, statically typed, compiled language has direct support to scoping with the help of keywords which are mentioned when the method or field is declared. However Python does not have such keywords since it is a scripting language, and it is interpreted instead of being compiled. Mainly, Access Modifiers can be categorized as Public, Protected and Private in a class.\n",
    "  Python uses the ‘_’ symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class. Access specifiers in Python have an important role to play in securing data from unauthorized access and in preventing it from being exploited. But it is not like other languages like Java and C++ since Python uses the concept of Name Mangling for achieving data hiding.\n",
    "A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers:\n",
    " 1)Public Access Modifier: Theoretically, public methods and fields can be accessed directly by any class.\n",
    " 2)Protected Access Modifier: Theoretically, protected methods and fields can be accessed within the same class it is declared and its subclass.\n",
    " 3)Private Access Modifier: Theoretically, private methods and fields can be only accessed within the same class it is declared.\n",

The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order).
